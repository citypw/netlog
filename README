This is netlog's README. The 1st thing I wanna talk about it's about
license. Netlog is a free software and it's under GPLv3. Please read
the gpl-3.0.txt if you want to know more details about GPLv3.

How to test the program:
#make

Open a terminal(tty) and start the server:
#./netlogd -C netlog.conf

Open a new terminal(tty) and start the client: 
#./netlog_client  //please types 10 times repeatly. Check the netlog.c:320 then you know why you have to do this.

Check the log in /tmp/netlog.log.

Netlog is very simple log server/client programs. I don't intend to
compare with famous log server, such as syslog or syslog-ng. I'm
writing this one just for fun. Some company what I was work for ,
which has always get used to wrote their own log server from
scratch. Now I write a simple log server framework for my own. Maybe I
will continue to improve it someday in the future when I think I
really need. If you have any question/suggestion about netlog, just
drop me a line.

btw: don't forget the most important principle that it's read the fuc*
source code if you want to modify the code according to your need.
